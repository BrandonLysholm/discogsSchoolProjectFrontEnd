This project was created for a school assignment in December 2023. The packages probably need updating to run it now.

The overall project relies on Discogs API to allow logged on users to search up artists and them to their favourite artists, as well as rate artists and albums. The user accounts are hardcoded, and there is currently no ability to add in new accounts.

The frontend is done in typescript and Vue as the frontend framework.

For the backend, it relies on: https://github.com/BrandonLysholm/discogsSchoolProjectBackEnd
